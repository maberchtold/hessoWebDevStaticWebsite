                    <p><em>
                        We are a little astronaut whose mission is to go back to his base on a certain planet. But our 
                        vehicle crashed and we are now forced to wander and jump across hostile planets to go back home. 
                        But inhabitants of those planets will see the astronaut as a threat and will try to kill him. We 
                        will evolve into a space environment on planets with a machine that leads us to the next point 
                        of our journey. Not only the inhabitants can be dangerous, the environment could also try to get 
                        you !

                    <p>The <strong>goal</strong> of the game:</p>
                    <p>
                        In this 2D adventure, you play as a stranded astronaut whose mission is to return to base after 
                        a crash leaves you wandering across hostile planets. Your goal is to navigate dangerous 
                        environments, avoid deadly inhabitants who see you as a threat, and jump through treacherous 
                        terrain. Survive each planet's challenges to continue your journey and make your way home.
                    </p>
                    <p>Game <strong>rules</strong>:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>You can walk and jump to navigate through each level.</li>
                        <li>Reaching specific points within a level grants you a checkpoint, allowing you to restart there if you die.</li>
                        <li>f you're touched by an enemy, hit a dangerous object, or fall into the void, you will die and respawn at the last checkpoint.</li>
                        <li>Your goal is to reach the end of the level, where a machine will transport you to the next stage.</li>
                        <li>Jumping on enemies will defeat them.</li>
